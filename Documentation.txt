Changes to the Parser.ssl file:
    Changess made to this file include the removal for support of old parser output tokens sRepeatStmt and sRepeatEnd
    and the addition  of new parser output tokens sPublic, sModule, sDoStmt, sBreakIf, sSubstring, sLength, sIndex.
    The main parse loop in this file has been modified to allow for mixing of declarations and statements. The main
    loop modifications have ensured continued support for sBegin and sEnd. The parsing of constant, type and variable
    declarations have been modified for Quby support. The parsing of Routines has been modified to support public
    and private functions and continue to emit sBegin and sEnd. The parsing of if, unless while, case and do
    has been modified or created. Support was added for elsif to make the emitted tokens look like that of nested
    PT if statements. Support was added for unless to convert it to "if" and "not" tokens. Support for else statements
    was added to case. Do Statement support was added to include sDoStmt and sBreakIf tokens. 

    Support for the String type and associated operators has been added. Char type support has been removed and 
    String has been added. The "?" operator has been added to the precedence level of "*". The "#" operator 
    has been added to the precedence level of "not". An additional precedence level has been added for "$".

Parser.pt:
- Copied contents from parser.def to the corresponding section. (lines 190-352)


Test Suites:
    Test suites are contained in the test/Phase2Tests folder. The example tests were moved to a new folder called old_tests, 
    Phase1 tests were moved to the folder test/Phase1Tests.

    The test suites .pt files that contains unit tests that are named after the tests to each specific changes that were made.

    The .test files are actual tests to test the .pt files to behave with certain expected traits, such as having a specific number of tokens.
    All the tests are expected to output "SUCCESS".

    Finally, the RunTests.bash automates the process of running all the .test files.
