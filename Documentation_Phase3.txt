Changes to the semantic.ssl file:
    Changes made to this file include adding the input semantic token definitions sPublic, sModule, sDoStmt, sBreakIf, sSubstring, sLength, 
    sIndex and removal of sRepeatStmt and sRepeatEnd to match the tokens in parser.ssl. The old output t-codes tRepeatBegin, tRpeatControl, 
    tLiteralChar, tRepeatTest were removed, the t-codes tFetchString, tAssignString, tStoreString, tSubscriptString are changed and new 
    t-codes tConcatenate, tSubstring, tLength, tIndex, tStringEqual, tCaseElse, tDoBegin, tDoBreakIf, tDoTest, tDoEnd are added to satisfy 
    the new requirement.

    Support for Quby's allowing mixing of declarations and statements were added. Support for handling declaration of anonymous modules and 
    the module's scope features were implemented. The PT char type was modified to support the Quby's string type. String comparison 
    with the equality or inequality sign is allowed. The PT repeat statements were modified to behave as Quby's do statements. PT's case 
    statements were modified to support Quby's case .. else statements.

- Change predefined Char type to predefined String type (line 790)
- Replace Char references with String references (lines 1020-1035, 2081)

Test Suites:
    Test suites are contained in the test/Phase3Tests folder.

    The test suites .pt files that contains unit tests that are named after the tests to each specific changes that were made.

    The .test files are actual tests to test the .pt files to behave with certain expected traits, such as having a specific number of tokens.
    All the tests are expected to output "SUCCESS".

    Finally, the RunTests.bash automates the process of running all the .test files.
